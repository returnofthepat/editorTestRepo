# Vim text editor assesment 

this [website][https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/vim-beginners-guide/] 

## Initial look:

	Use of redo/undo were quite helpful but not astonishing Deleting large
	chunks of code was difficult to do. I tried entering visual mode and
	selecting the chunk of code, then pressing d to delete it but instead
	left visual mode. After trying different variations of this attempt I
	chose to just manually press d to delta the chunk line by
	line. Relatively easy to understand, the mode function is a bit odd
	but for making sure that files are saved and closed properly this
	seems to be more helpful. However when actually coding in the editors
	I found this to slow me down significantly. Switching between modes
	isn't second nature and the mode you’re currently in is only displayed
	at the bottom of the file.  Saving and exiting the editor is slightly
	obscure from what I’m used to as well. I need to make sure I'm in the
	command mode, then save(:w), then exit(:q); this isn't terrible, just
	peculiar.  Retrieving my file after stopping work proved to be
	aggravating. 
	
## Productivity curve 

	In terms of writing code it didn't take ages to become productive. I
	do not like the modes, I find them to be a minor inconvience that
	compounds to be quite annoying. However I believe that they can be a
	good safety crutch for beginners. Compiling a program in a terminal was 
	a bit odd to me at first but I gradually got used to it. Another thing
	I really enjoyed about Vim was its predesor "Vi". It's particularly
	helpful for small quick edits but Vim has more features and should be
	used for proper editing/debugging. 

## GDB

To start debugging press ":", then type "!", then
input your command; in this case I typed "gdb
"
## Conlusion

I believe that Vim is quite a powerful and helpful editor despite it's quirks.
