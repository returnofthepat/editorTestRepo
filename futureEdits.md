## Universal listing 
	in my emacs assesment i use "-" then use ":" in my neovim
	assesment. I should make it universal and find a charecter that
	can be used for both without confusion. 
	
## Find a good way to segment the chapters
	so far i've used markdown to write the assesments, in doing so 
	some of my division of information isn't as clean as it could
	be. So i should find a way to make it more uniform and logical 
	to read, this may just come with time and moving things around.
