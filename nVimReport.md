# NeoVim editor assesment 

<!-- revise keybindings not all Vim keys work for NeoVim -->
<!-- clean this entire thing up and add missing chunks -->

## Basic Keybinding guide 
### Basic Navigation
	
	h: move left
	l: move right
	k: move up
	j: move down
	C-f: page down
	C-b: page up
	
### Modes

	To change mode you must be in Command mode(normal mode).Command mode
	is where you should cut, copy, and paste.

	Insert mode: This is the mode where you enter text and format the files 
	visual appearance.(i)

	Visual mode: This mode is where you should highlight portions of text
	to cut, copy, paste, etc (v).
	
	Visual block mode: As a beginner I would recomend staying away from this
	mode as you have better places to focus your attention. This mode lets 
	you slected text in block shaped sections.
	
### Editing 
	
	Commands are excuted from command mode after typing ":"
	w - save
    q - quit
	wq or x - save and quit 
	q! - quit without saving 
	!- used to override system safety measures
	yy - copy current line 
	p - paste after the cursor 
	P- paste before the cursor
	
### Searching and replacing 

	/:keyword - search for 'keyword'
	n - move to next search result
	N - move to previous serach result
	
### Moving around 

	gg - go to the begining of the file 
	G - go to the end of the file 
	:[num] - go to line number
	
### Multiple files 

	e filename - open file 
	bn - next buffer
	bp - previous buffer
## initial thoughts:
	
	When starting up neoVim I did not notice a difference between it and
	Vim, upon doing some research I found that the main advertized
	usefulness of neoVim is it's adaptability

### resources 

	My main issue with neovim is the lack of documentation for
	extensions. Part of the appeal of neovim is the addition
	extensions, these help neovim become even more powerful from the
	out of the box version of the editor.
