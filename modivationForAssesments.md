# Motivation for Assesments

I wanted to create a mostly objective for Vim, NeoVim, and Emacs for beginning programs to help them decide what is the best choice for them. 

## Personal Bias 

I have been working on cs projects since 3rd grade and used my first
terminal based editor in 2022 during my cs50 class. When it comes to
editors I truly enjoy something with out of the box usability. I tried
to acknowledge any point where I feel I was biased throughout the
reports, as I couldn't stay complety objective.

## Defintions 

Text editor: A basic computer program that allows a user to write,
modify, and manipulate plain text. In most use cases is used for
documentation and program code; but can be used for configuration
files as well. You could think of a text editor like google docs basic
function. Although there is fundamental differences which I will
explain at the end of this repo this basic idea will do fine for now.
