Tools:
Use of redo/undo were quite helpful but not astonishing 
Deleting large chunks of code was difficult to do. I tried entering visual mode and selecting the chunk of code, then pressing d to delete it but instead left visual mode. After trying different variations of this attempt I chose to just manually press d to delta the chunk line by line. Relatively easy to understand, the mode function is a bit odd but for making sure that files are saved and closed properly this seems to be more helpful. However when actually coding in the editors I found this to slow me down significantly. Switching between modes isn't second nature and the mode you’re currently in is only displayed at the bottom of the file. 
Saving and exiting the editor is slightly obscure from what I’m used to as well. I need to make sure I'm in the command mode, then save(:w), then exit(:q); this isn't terrible, just peculiar. 
Retrieving my file after stopping work proved to be aggravating. 
Productivity curve:

I didn’t notice myself transitioning into a good work flow while working in this editor, the mode function often interrupted it shortly after entering a flow or right before the cusp of entering it. Although the compiling of VIM makes sense I think it’s odd, I believe it's beneficial since you can look at your code/edit it while compiling, but opening a terminal to compile your code still feels incorrect and I don't see it progressing to second nature in the near future.
